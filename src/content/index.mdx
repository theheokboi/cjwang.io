I'm a fourth year Ph.D. student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/)'s Computer Science department and [AquaLab](https://aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu/), 
where I work with Prof. [Fabi√°n E. Bustamante](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~fabianb/). 
Together, we research on Internet Measurement, network Infrastructure, and Internet Resilience, where we try to understand in today's world why networks fail, how they respond to failures, and what to do to make the Internet more resilient. 

Before my Ph.D., I got my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Master's degree in Communication Engineering, both from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/).  I worked briefly as a customer engineer at Microsoft, Taiwan before joining Northwestern.
You can check out my full cv [here](/pdf/cv.pdf).  

In an alternate universe, I traded research papers for 
[espresso machines](https://lamarzoccousa.com/home-products/espresso-machines/linea-mini/), 
[guitar strings](https://www.ibanez.com/na/products/detail/rg8527_00_06.html), and 
befriending [wombats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_wombat).
